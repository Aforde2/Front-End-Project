#Our goal
We set out to create an app that allows the user to pair different food and beverage combinations utilizing the Spoonacular and Drinks Digital Apis.

#The problems we've faced
The first problem we faced was getting comfortable merging our branches and keeping a clean working main branch.
The second problem we faced was selecting the right APIs and getting them to display the right information with our fetch calls.
The final problem we faced was with positioning our elements and implementing mobile responsiveness.
